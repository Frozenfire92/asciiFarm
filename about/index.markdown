Hi my name is Joel.  

I'm currently studying Computing Science at SMU and have been making awesome connections in the process. I believe in the power of open source and people. This blog will serve as a hub for my ramblings and whatever tips/tricks I encounter along my journey. I also enjoy ASCII art, hence ASCII Farm.
