Hi my name is Joel.  

I'm currently studying Computing Science at SMU and have been making awesome connections in the process. I believe in the power of open source and people. This website will serve as a hub for my portfolio, ramblings, and whatever tips/tricks I encounter along my journey. I also enjoy ASCII art, hence ASCII Farm.

This site is [Github](http://github.com) hosted and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered with a theme forked from [Matt Harzewski](http://www.webmaster-source.com)
