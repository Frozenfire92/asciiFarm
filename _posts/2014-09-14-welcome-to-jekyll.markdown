I recently held a lecture at my school to teach and familiarize students with Linux. I used a VirtualBox VM for ease of use showing multiple desktop environments in Ubuntu. While setting it up I had to dig around to find how to make it full screen. It really is this easy

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms
```

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms
{% endhighlight %}

Happy virtualization!
