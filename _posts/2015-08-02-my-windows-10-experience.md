Like most people who game and use Linux I am forced to retain a copy of Windows on my machine to run games and make them with Unity. I hope one day the future looks brighter for gaming on Linux \***points at NVIDIA and ATI**\*, but that is another argument for another day.

As with most, my recent machine came with Windows 8.1 and I strongly disliked it. I found it too far off course from what Windows is and didn't make using it pleasant. When I heard Windows 10 was going to be a free upgrade I was quite excited as I tried the technical preview earlier this year and was impressed.

Until I installed it. The upgrade process was smooth, however there was one glaring issue. When I logged in to Elder Scrolls Online I was met with brutal framerates (20fps from 60-80fps) and extra loading screens. I asked around online and people who upgraded to 10 had the same issue, where people who did a fresh install noticed no performance difference. Having downloaded Windows 10 and put it on a USB drive I figured why not do the fresh install. The fresh install was extremely fast and worked quite well. There was only one issue, my computer was OEM where the product key is embedded in the BIOS. This means the fresh installed Windows wouldn't activate and I was constantly greeted by a message in the bottom right of my screen.

After reading online I found that others had encountered this as well and the proper solution was to reinstall Windows 8, upgrade to 10, get the activated product key out of 10, and then do a fresh install. What a pain as I already had Windows 10 and Elder Scrolls Online (50GB) reinstalled. Also I had confirmed at this point that the fresh install did make the game run at normal performance. I decided to call Lenovo support thinking they may be able to give me a product key to avoid having to reinstall Windows 8 with a cd that wasn't included with my computer. I mean surely Microsoft anticipated this? Wrong was I, the only thing they could offer me was the Windows 8.1 cd for $70. Well I wasn't about to shell out money for something that should have been included (especially because Microsoft wants everyone on Windows 10?). I was determined to get it working, so I had to go through the following process

- Download Windows 8.1 to a USB with [this tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media)
- Do a fresh install of 8.1
- Do the Windows 10 upgrade through 8.1
- Get the Windows 10 product key with [ProduKey](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html) found from [this article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2015/07/30/windows-10-updating-reinstalling-and-activation-guide-essential-advice-to-avoid-problems/)
- Get Windows 10 to a USB with [this tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)
- Do a fresh install
- Profit

I thought this was supposed to be fun?
