Over the weekend I used the new Firefox Developer Edition to develop an addon to sync your bookmarks to a github repository ([link](https://github.com/valencik/taby)). My first impressions of the `darker side of Firefox` were quite pleasant. Developing an addon with the SDK was very quick and easy. Sometimes the documentation was lacking, but I guess that's where the open source community comes in right. I also found myself wishing there was a way to inspect your addons GUI (panel, etc.). One caveat with the dark interface is some favicons were impossible to see. I'm excited to see where this goes! Go build something!
