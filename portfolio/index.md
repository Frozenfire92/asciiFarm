# October 2014
- Presented an event for the SMU Computer Science and Mathematics Society called Teach Me How to Linux

# September 2014
- Working on an open source threat modeling tool called [SeaSponge](https://github.com/mozilla/seasponge) for the [Mozilla Winter of Security 2014](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Automation/WinterOfSecurity2014)

# July 2014
- 1st Place in the SaaSy Hackathon @ [Volta Labs](http://www.voltaeffect.com/)
  - My team prototyped an open analytics software to allow individuals/organizations have an easy to use API and web interface to show the types of analytics they collect with their applications openly. 

# May 2014

  - I was a part of team `Thunderscore` and we prototyped a mario-kart-esque game called [HalKart](https://github.com/Glavin001/HalKart). We used Unity3D and OpenStreetMap data to reconstruct Halifax in our racing game for the Ouya console.

# April 2014
- Web designer for the [Hack-A-Week 2014](https://github.com/SMUhackaweek/SMU-Hack-A-Week-2014)
  - SMU hired me to design a [website](http://smuhackaweek.github.io/SMU-Hack-A-Week-2014/) to promote their revamped high school programming competition.

# March 2014
- Presented an event for the SMU Computer Science and Mathematics Society called Teach Me How to Unity

# February 2014
- Entry for [McHacks 2014](http://mchacks.io/) @ [McGill](http://www.mcgill.ca/)
  - I was a part of `SMU Team Delta` and we created [One Small Leap](https://github.com/Frozenfire92/One.Small.Leap) using Unity3D and Leap Motion. The goal of the hack is to use your hands to fly a space shuttle into space.
- Entry for [Flappy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam)
  - My significant other and I created a game we call [Sad Heart](http://frozenfire.itch.io/sad-heart) for Flappy Jam. The goal was to use a language most first year computer science students would use and document it well so anyone can learn from it.

# January 2014
- Founder and President of the SMU Computer Science and Mathematics Society.

# October 2013
- Entry for Halifax Game Jam 2013
  - For my first hackathon I created a simple game using Unity3D called Porter.
