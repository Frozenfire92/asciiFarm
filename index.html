<h2>About</h2>
I'm currently studying Computing Science at SMU and have been making awesome connections in the process. I believe in the power of open source and people. This website will serve as a hub for my portfolio, ramblings, and whatever tips/tricks I encounter along my journey. I also enjoy ASCII art, hence ASCII Farm.
